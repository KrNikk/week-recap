## `<Formik />`
`<Formik>` is a component that helps you with building forms. It uses a render props pattern made popular by libraries like React Motion and React Router.

### Installation
You can install Formik with NPM, Yarn, or a good ol' <script> via unpkg.com.

NPM

`npm install formik --save  `

or

`yarn add formik`


### The Gist 


Formik keeps track of your form's state and then exposes it plus a few reusable methods and event handlers (handleChange, handleBlur, and handleSubmit) to your form via props. handleChange and handleBlur work exactly as expected--they use a name or id attribute to figure out which field to update.
